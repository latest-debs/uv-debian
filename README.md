# uv for Debian

[uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) — an extremely fast Python package and
project manager, written in Rust — packaged for Debian as part of
[latest-debs](https://github.com/latest-debs).

## Install

Via the latest-debs apt repository:

```sh
sudo extrepo enable latest-debs
sudo apt update
sudo apt install uv
```

Or download a `.deb` from the [Releases](https://github.com/latest-debs/uv-debian/releases) page:

sudo dpkg -i uv_*.deb
```

## Building

Run the [Build uv for Debian](../../actions) workflow on GitHub with the
desired upstream version. Packaging is driven by
[debian-multiarch-builder](https://github.com/ranjithrajv/debian-multiarch-builder).

## Collaborate with us

latest-debs is a community effort — nobody "owns" this package and there's
no application to fill out. If you rely on it and want to help keep it
fresh, watching for a new upstream release or fixing a build hiccup, jump
in. Open an issue, send a PR, or drop into
[org discussions](https://github.com/orgs/latest-debs/discussions). Every
bit of help keeps this useful for everyone else who `apt install`s it.

## Disclaimer

Unofficial packaging only. For issues with uv itself, see
[astral-sh/uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv).
